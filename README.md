The work is mysterious and important.

Terminal of Woe is a surreal data refinement experience inspired by the terminals from the TV series Severance. Built entirely on iPad and iPhone using Codea — a visual coding environment for creative projects — this app recreates the eerie, opaque task of Macro Data Refinement

### What is this?

Inside the terminal, your role is to observe a grid of numbers. Some will feel… incorrect. Highlight them. Refine them. Save the goat. Submit your grievances.

This project is:
- A playable minimalist simulation
- A love letter to Severance
- A living demo of what’s possible with Codea on iOS
- Fully open-source and remixable

This includes the fully exported Xcode project from Codea. The `TerminalofWoe.codea` project is importable into Codea, but the entire thing can be built-and-run for iOS without Codea.

### Built With

- [Codea](https://codea.io) – iPad/iPhone app for creative coding in Lua
- Lua
- Aesthetic discomfort (see: [A Week Eating Dogfood](https://sim.coffee/a-week-eating-dogfood/))

### Issue a Greivance

If something doesn’t feel quite right — feel free to open an issue.
All grievances will be received, categorized, and quietly archived.
